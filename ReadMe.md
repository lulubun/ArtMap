<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is always local art to discover wherever you are. Art Map uses geolocation to find local art galleries from the user's location. Art Map also provides website information and driving directions to the gallery.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Geolocation is called automatically upon loading the app so users only need to choose a marker to explore their options</p>
<p>Clicking on a marker will reveal the name of the gallery, it's street address, a button to show driving directions, and a button to visit any available gallery web site.</p>
